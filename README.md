## What is teleworking?

Teleworking is a model where employees work remotely while communicating with their colleagues through telephone, email or video conferencing. Working remotely involves employees performing their daily tasks from a location other than a traditional office, such as a home office or a coffee shop. Teleworkers may also work in company buildings outside of the main office, such as in another branch. Companies often require teleworkers to work during designated hours with employees in the office, such as from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.


A teleoperator and teleworking refer to different concepts, mainly related to the nature of work and how it's conducted.

## Teleoperator
This term is commonly used in fields like robotics and refers to a person who controls a machine or a robot from a distance. The teleoperator can manipulate the robot's actions from another location, often through a computer interface. This is especially used in situations where direct human involvement is not possible or dangerous such as space missions, nuclear facilities, or dealing with hazardous substances.

## Teleworking
Also known as telecommuting, it refers to the practice of employees working from locations other than their traditional office, typically from home, by using telecommunication technologies. This could be for any industry or job type, not just specific to controlling machines or robots. Teleworking allows for greater flexibility in work hours and can contribute to improved work-life balance. Tasks can be performed through email, video conferencing, phone calls, and cloud-based applications.

## Teleworking vs. telecommuting

Though these are similar terms, there are several key differences between these two concepts. Here are some areas in which teleworking and telecommuting differ:
Definition

Teleworking and telecommuting both refer to remote work that employees perform. However, telework is a broader term that means working outside of a traditional office setting, often using preferred personal devices. Meanwhile, telecommuting refers to using technology to complete a job away from a central location, like a customer service agent who answers customer queries from home.
