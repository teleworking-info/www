A teleoperator and teleworking refer to different concepts, mainly related to the nature of work and how it's conducted.

1. Teleoperator: This term is commonly used in fields like robotics and refers to a person who controls a machine or a robot from a distance. The teleoperator can manipulate the robot's actions from another location, often through a computer interface. This is especially used in situations where direct human involvement is not possible or dangerous such as space missions, nuclear facilities, or dealing with hazardous substances.

2. Teleworking: Also known as telecommuting, it refers to the practice of employees working from locations other than their traditional office, typically from home, by using telecommunication technologies. This could be for any industry or job type, not just specific to controlling machines or robots. Teleworking allows for greater flexibility in work hours and can contribute to improved work-life balance. Tasks can be performed through email, video conferencing, phone calls, and cloud-based applications.
